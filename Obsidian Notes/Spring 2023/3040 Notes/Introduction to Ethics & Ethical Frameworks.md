##### Ethical Point of View: Respecting other people and their values in your community

##### Selfish Point of View: Respect only their own needs and desires

#### Why are Ethics Important to Study:
- Be able to look at situations from different viewpoints
- Be a better listener
		- Better understand the other person's side and not just hear it
- Look at issues more holistically
		- Some ethical issues aren't obvious and take some deep dividing to come to appropiate decisions
- Learn what questions to ask when presented with a moral problem
- Help you, your company, or your team to pause before taking action and think
		- I am able to create/collect this technology/data, but should I?

### Ethical Theories
- Ethical theories are attempts to provide a clear, unified account of what our ethical obligations are
Voluntary vs. Involuntary:
	- Ethics is focused on the voluntary, moral choices people make because they have decided they ought to take one course of action rather than an alternative

Subjective Relitivism:
	- Each person decides right and wrong for themselves
	- No universal moral norms of right and wrong
	- "What's right for you may not be right be for me"

Cultural Relativism:
	- the meaning of right and wrong depend on a society's actual moral guidelines
	- these guidelines vary from place to place and from time to time
	- an action may be right in one society at one time and wrong in another society or at another time
	- for example the minimum drinking age across the world

Divine Command Theory:
	- The theory that right actions are those aligned with the will of God and wrong actions are those contrary to will of God.
	- Moral guidelines are in a holy book, which Jews, Christains, and Muslims all believe that God inspired

Ethical Egoism:
	- Each person should focus exclusively on his or her self-interest
	- The morally right action is the action that will provide that reason with the maximum long term benefit

Kantianism:
	- Believed that peoples's actions ought to be guided by universal moral laws
	- Belived all principles must be based on reason
	- Felt as if people, by nature, easily become extremely corrupt and therefore need rules of ethical behavior
	- Most moral laws related to this is found in the Bible
	- People apart of this should focus on what you should do and what you want to do does not matter
	- Categorical Imperative: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
	- First Formulation: You should act only on moral rules that you can imagine everyone else following without deriving a logical contradiction
	- Second Formulation: Act so that you always treat both yourseldfand other people as ends in themselves, and never only as mere means. Don't "use" people
	- Rule based
	- Every person is eqully valuable

Act Utilitarianiam:
	- An action is good if the net effect of all affected beings is to produce more happiness than unhappiness
		- Morally significant being: Any being that can experinece pain and pleasure
	- Based on consequences of actions (consequences matter more than intentions)
	- Action is right if the net effect is to increase total happiness and is determined through calculations
	- Utility: the tendency of an object to produce happiness or prevent unhappiness for an individual or a community
	- Principle of Utility: An action is right or wrong to the extent that it increases or decreases the total happiness of the affected parties

Seven attributes that can used to increase or decrease the weight of a particular pleasure or pain:
	- Intensity
	- Duration
	- Certainty
	- Propinquity
	- Fecundity
	- Purity
	- Extent

Rule Utilitarianism:
	- We adopt moral rules that if followed by everyone lead to the greatest increase in total happiness over all affected parties
	- Rule based which means calculating is done on a rule and not every action
	- Moral rules are the rules that are needed to gain the benfits of social living

Social Contract Theory:
	- Rational people will follow the "rules" on the condition that other people will follow them too
	- Associated with individuals rights and societal duties
	- When declaring wheteher a rule was right and wrong, checks to see if person's rights were violated
	- We should colelctively promote human rights, such as the rights to life, liberty, property, and privacy
	- Means that we implicitly accept a social contract
		- The social contract is an establishment of moral rules to govern relations among citizens
		- We agree that the government is allowed to enforce these rules
		- In ideal society no one is "too good" for rules
			- this prevents society from enacting bad rules
		- Classification of rights according to the duties they put on others:
			- Negative Right
			- Positive Right
			- Absolute Right
			- Limited Right

Virtue Ethics:
	- A right action is an action that a virtuous person, acting in character would do in the same circumstance
	- A virtuous person is a person who possesses and lives out the virtues and does the right thing at the right time for the right reason
	- The virtues are those character traits human beings needs in order to flourish  and be truly happy
	- Moral wisdom or discernment takes precedence over any rule
