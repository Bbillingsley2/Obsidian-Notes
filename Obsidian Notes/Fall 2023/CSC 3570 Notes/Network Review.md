-  Whatever you wearing whether it is a watch, phone, or earbuds, if it uses Bluetooth, it is your Personal Area Network (PAN)

- Almost everything is networked at this point. A host can now be an actuator, meter, sensor, information display, personal digital assistants, tablets, watches, etc.

- Network Architectures

	- Peer-to-Peer Networks
		-  Popular in early PC network designs
		- No central agent providing coordination
		- Works only in small networks
		- The broadcast storm required to share information would saturate larger networks

	- Client-Server Networks
		- Most common format for modern networks (especially in business)
		- Central servers provide core time, addressing, directory, name service, storage, and logistical services
		- Clients may be advised or totally controlled by central service providers

- Physical Network Topology 

	- Bus 
	- Star
	- Ring
	- Mesh
	- Point-to-point
	- Point-to-multipoint
	- Hybrid 


- Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model
	- Computer scientists love layering technologies to make new creations 
	- "Do one thing well and hand off ... "

	- 7. Application (data)
		- Mail Servers/ Clients
		- Web Server/ Clients
		- FTP Server/ Clients
		- Remote Access Clients
		- Almost any service application server 
	- 6. Presentation (data)
		- Mail Servers/ Clients
		- Web Server/ Clients
		- FTP Server/ Clients
		- Remote Access Clients
		- Almost any service application server 
	- 5. Session (data)
		- Mail Servers/ Clients
		- Web Server/ Clients
		- FTP Server/ Clients
		- Remote Access Clients
		- Almost any service application server 
	- 4. Transport (segments)
		- gateways and specialty devices
	- 3. Network (packets)
		- routers and firewalls
	- 2. Data link (frames)
		- Switches and bridges
	- 1. Physical (bits)
		- Hub and repeater

	- Each time information goes to the next layer, it gets wrapped with something else and gets bigger and fitted for the style of transport for that layer.
